## Introduction
Demand forecasting is crucial for SMEs to manage inventory, optimize supply chain operations, and improve customer satisfaction. This project demonstrates how to build a regression model to predict demand using data procured through web scraping.

## Data Procurement
### Tools
- **MainContentExtractor**: A Python module to extract data for LLMs


### Steps
1. **Identify Data Sources**: Choose websites relevant to your industry for scraping data.
2. **Scrape Data**: Use Puppeteer to extract data. Below is an example script:

    ```python
    import requests
    from main_content_extractor import MainContentExtractor

    # Get HTML using requests
    url = "https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web"
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.encoding = 'utf-8'
    content = response.text

    # Get HTML with main content extracted from HTML
    extracted_html = MainContentExtractor.extract(content)

    # Get HTML with main content extracted from Markdown
    extracted_markdown = MainContentExtractor.extract(content, output_format="markdown")
    ```

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Clean the Data**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might improve model performance, such as extracting the month and year from the date.

## Model Building
### Tools
- **Python**: For data manipulation and model building.
- **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library in Python.

### Steps
1. **Choose a Regression Algorithm**: Start with linear regression and explore more complex models if needed.
2. **Split the Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Train the Model**: Use the training data to train the model.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Example
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('demand_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
data['month'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date']).dt.month
data['year'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date']).dt.year
X = data[['price', 'month', 'year']]
y = data['demand']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

## Model Deployment
1. **Save the Model**: Save the trained model for future use.
2. **Create an API**: Develop an API to serve the model predictions using frameworks like Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js).

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to building a demand forecasting model for SMEs using self-procured data. By following these steps, you can create a robust model to help optimize your business operations.
